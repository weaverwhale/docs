### Find correlated metrics

<img src="/find-correlated-metrics.png" />

Clicking on an error, or line on a graph will allow you to view correlated metrics, as well as related traces and events. This can be useful for:

- Similar metrics in the same container
- Correlated events in different containers 
- Similar issues in the past, and how they were resolved
