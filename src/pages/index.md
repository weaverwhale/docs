## 🐳🐳🐳 Welcome!

This documentation is intended to provide a quick startup guide for new developers, as well as documentation I felt important to record while working.

The onboarding section can be used in place of the [older documentation found here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1FxmH7eIDj0x3-BvxqiavkDCKvpjidL0aLaGz4Ray_dY/edit#), but feel free to reference both as-needed.
