# Fallback to old system

If summary is super slow; if something is down

we have complete redundancy from the old system (mongo) to the new system (bigquery)

In the admin page, under **TW Dev > General > Summary Nexus**

We can unchech those buttons and switch everyone back to the old system

## dont do this lightly

It's a fallback incase something is really wrong; pressure valve
