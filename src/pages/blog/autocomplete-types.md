## I want to create a string type with a predefined list from an array, but also allow it to accept something not from the list as well

```ts
const SOME_CONST = ['a', 'b', 'c'] as const;
type SomeConstKey = (typeof SOME_CONST)[number] | (string & {});
```

To keep the autocomplete with flexibility, you add the ‚Äò& {}‚Äô.

### Explanation

any key of the const array and NOT just any string - but rather any string+object.  ‚Äústring‚Äù is a generic type, and therefore a union with it will override the specificity from the const array.  However, string & {} isn‚Äôt a generic type that will override the other options.  That being said, since every single thing in JS is basically some kind of object, a string will match the type of string & {} as well as just string.  Therefore, doing something like const x: SomeConstKey = 'y' won‚Äôt cause any issues, since y is still of type string & {}.
