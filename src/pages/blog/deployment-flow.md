TW PR/DEPLOYMENT Flow

Do work
Test Locally
Create PR
Test on staging (with test links)
ONLY THEN add reviewer and send in slack


Let's do the process
- make a branch for BE and FE
- make your changes
- Test in stg very carefullyÂ  (deploy to STG BE and FE)
- I will approve the BE - deploy it to prod
- Make client channel point to prod
- test yourself on prod
- I'll approve the client, and it will be pushed to prod
