## What is Copilot

[GitHub Copilot](https://github.com/features/copilot) uses the OpenAI Codex to suggest code and entire functions in real-time, right from your editor.

## How it helps?

Trained on billions of lines of code, GitHub Copilot turns natural language prompts into coding suggestions across dozens of languages.

## Example

```javascript
// a javascript function that exports hello world after accepting a name
// below is all generated from copilot, I just pressed tab:
//---------------------------------------------------------------
// prior to using copilot, you would have to write the function yourself
// now, you can just ask copilot to write it for you
function helloWorld(name) { 
  console.log(`Hello ${name}!`); 
}
```

## How to use it?

You can use it in VSCode, Atom, and JetBrains IDEs. You can also use it in the browser with GitHub Codespaces.

Everyone in TW should have a licesne for it. If you don't, please contact your manager.
